# 🎯 KIKI Skeleton Generation System

## Overview

KIKI has been redesigned as a **project skeleton generator** that creates a complete project structure with all necessary configuration files for Claude Code, rather than generating actual code.

## 🚀 What KIKI Generates

### Core Files Generated

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Claude Code configuration with:
   - Project overview and MVP features
   - Tech stack details
   - Development workflow
   - MCP tool recommendations
   - Important links and resources

2. **PRD.md** - Product Requirements Document with:
   - Executive summary
   - Problem statement and target audience
   - MVP scope with user stories
   - Technical requirements
   - Success metrics
   - Competitive analysis

3. **MASTER_PLAN.md** - Strategic roadmap with:
   - Sprint planning (3 sprints of 7 days each)
   - Quick wins and immediate actions
   - Known challenges and solutions
   - Tech decisions explained
   - Time-saving "cheat codes"

4. **DATABASE.md** - Database documentation with:
   - Entity relationship diagrams
   - Table schemas
   - RLS policies
   - Migration strategy
   - Performance considerations

5. **Configuration Files**:
   - `.env.example` - Environment variables template
   - `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
   - `.gitignore` - Standard ignore patterns
   - `README.md` - Project setup guide

6. **Folder Structure**:
   ```
   project-name/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── app/         # Next.js app router
   │   ├── components/  # React components
   │   ├── lib/         # Utilities

   │   └── API_REFERENCE.md
   ├── commands/        # Claude Code commands
   ├── agents/          # AI agent definitions
   └── tests/           # Test files
   ```

## 🎮 Pokemon-Style Tutorial Experience

Each phase now includes:

### Tutorial Overlay Component
- Introduces the assistant's personality
- Explains what will happen in the phase
- Shows step-by-step process
- Provides tips and best practices
- Remembers if user has seen it (localStorage)

### Master Prompts for Each Assistant

1. **Peter (Phase 1)** - The Project Mentor
   - Socratic questioning approach
   - Focuses on concept, user, MVP, validation
   - Anti-jargon, uses analogies

2. **Sara (Phase 2)** - The Digital Detective
   - Finds competitors and inspiration
   - Recommends GitHub repos and MCPs
   - Data-driven but accessible

3. **Tony (Phase 3)** - The Pragmatic Architect
   - Anti-hype, pro-results
   - Explains tech like LEGO
   - Boring tech that works

4. **Chris (Phase 4)** - The Documentation Compulsive
   - Clear, structured writing
   - Converts complexity to simplicity
   - Everything has a reason

5. **Quentin (Phase 5)** - The DevOps Sherpa
   - Checklist master
   - Anticipates common errors
   - Calm under pressure

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

1. **Project Generator Class** (`/src/lib/project-generator.ts`)
   - Takes structured project data
   - Generates all files programmatically
   - Creates ZIP using JSZip library
   - Returns downloadable blob

2. **API Endpoint** (`/src/app/api/projects/generate/route.ts`)
   - Authenticates user
   - Fetches project and phase data
   - Constructs ProjectData object
   - Calls generator and returns ZIP

3. **Data Flow**:
   ```
   User completes phases → Data saved to Supabase → 
   Generate button clicked → API fetches all data → 
   ProjectGenerator creates files → ZIP downloaded
   ```

### Frontend Updates

1. **Tutorial Overlay** (`/src/components/project/tutorial-overlay.tsx`)
   - Reusable component for all phases
   - Progressive disclosure pattern
   - Animated and engaging

2. **Phase Components** - Updated with:
   - Tutorial integration
   - Progress indicators
   - Better visual hierarchy
   - Actual AI chat simulation

3. **Phase 5 Export** - Now includes:
   - Real ZIP download for skeleton
   - Multiple export options (GitHub, local, deploy)
   - Success celebration screen

# TaskFlow - Claude Code Configuration

## 🎯 Project Overview
TaskFlow helps remote teams coordinate across time zones with smart scheduling and real-time collaboration.

## 👤 Target User
Remote team leaders

## 🔧 Core Problem
Coordination across time zones

## 🚀 MVP Features
- Task creation and assignment
- Real-time collaboration
- Time zone aware scheduling

## 💻 Tech Stack
### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

[... continues with full configuration ...]
```

## 🎯 Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Code Generation** = No outdated code
2. **Guidance Focus** = Users understand what they're building
3. **Claude Code Ready** = Perfect integration with AI development
4. **Educational** = Users learn the methodology
5. **Flexible** = Users can adapt the skeleton to their needs

## 🚦 Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- Master prompts for all 5 assistants
- Tutorial overlay component
- Project generator system
- File generation logic
- Phase 1 and 5 UI updates
- ZIP download functionality

### 🚧 To Do
- Update Phases 2, 3, 4 with Pokemon style
- Add actual AI integration for chat
- Implement GitHub export option
- Add progress persistence
- Create admin dashboard

## 🎮 Usage Flow

1. User starts wizard → Sees KIKI introduction
2. Phase 1: Peter helps conceptualize → Tutorial → Chat → Output
3. Phase 2: Sara researches → Tutorial → Findings → Tasks
4. Phase 3: Tony plans tech → Tutorial → Stack selection → Architecture
5. Phase 4: Chris documents → Tutorial → Preview → Generation
6. Phase 5: Quentin exports → Tutorial → Download options → ZIP file

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

1. **No Real Code Generation**: Only structure and configuration
2. **Educational First**: Each phase teaches concepts
3. **Personality Driven**: Each assistant has unique character
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed when needed
5. **Celebration Moments**: Positive reinforcement throughout

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Complete UI updates for all phases
2. Test full generation flow
3. Add error handling and edge cases
4. Implement actual AI chat (optional)
5. Deploy and test with real users

This transformation makes KIKI a true project kickoff assistant that generates the skeleton and guidance needed to start building with Claude Code, without the complexity and maintenance burden of actual code generation.
