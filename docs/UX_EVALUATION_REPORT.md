## üîß **Technical Investigation Needed**

1. **Phase Progression Logic**: Investigate if there's backend logic that should enable next phases
2. **System Prompts**: Check if AI assistants have proper system prompts for all phases
3. **Database States**: Verify if project phases are tracked in database
4. **Frontend State Management**: Check if phase enabling logic exists but has bugs

## üí° **KIKI Personality Assessment**

The current personality implementation works well:
- ‚úÖ Humor is present but not overwhelming
- ‚úÖ Defensive stance against gatekeeping comes through
- ‚úÖ Professional tone with personality touches
- ‚úÖ Copy feels authentic to the brand

**Personality Refinement Needed**: 
- Make humor more subtle as requested
- Ensure consistency across all AI assistants when they become accessible

## üì∏ **Screenshots Captured**
- `kiki-landing-page.png` - Landing page with personality content
- `kiki-chat-interface-peter.png` - Desktop chat interface
- `kiki-chat-interface-mobile.png` - Mobile responsive view

---

## üèÜ **Overall Assessment**

**Strengths**: Excellent foundation, good AI integration, strong brand personality, professional design

**Critical Blocker**: Phase progression prevents users from experiencing the full platform value

**Recommendation**: Fix phase progression as absolute priority - the platform has great potential but users currently cannot complete the intended workflow.
